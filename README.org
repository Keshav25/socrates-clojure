#+TITLE: Socrates Clojure AI Assistant
#+AUTHOR: Kesh
#+DATE: 2025-12-26

* Introduction

Socrates is a minimal viable AI assistant built in Clojure using literate programming.
It acts as a Personal Data Assistant (PDA) with access to your Emacs knowledge base
through clomacs integration. (This project is the product of me testing LLMs, I do not recommend running this.)

* Features

- Speech input via Whisper (whisper.cpp)
- Speech output via espeak
- Ollama integration for LLM capabilities
- RAG system for document retrieval
- MCP client for tool execution
- Emacs integration (org-ql, memacs, denote) via clomacs
- Context management for conversation history

* Requirements

- Clojure (via clj or lein)
- Ollama running locally
- whisper.cpp installed (optional, for STT)
- espeak installed (optional, for TTS)
- Emacs with clomacs (optional, for Emacs integration)

* Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   clj -M:test
   #+END_SRC

3. Configure in =resources/config.edn=

* Usage

** Development

The system is developed as a literate program in =socrates.org=.

To work with the code:

1. Open =socrates.org= in Emacs
2. Execute code blocks with =C-c C-c=
3. Tangle source files with =C-c C-v t=
4. Run tests with =clj -M:test=

** Running the System

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
clj -M -m socrates.core
#+END_SRC

* Architecture

See =socrates.org= for complete architecture documentation.

* Development Approach

- Literate programming (org-mode with org-babel)
- TDD + TCR hybrid approach
- Comprehensive documentation alongside code
- Self-documenting tests with full context
